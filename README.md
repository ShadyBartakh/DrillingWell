# Well Drilling Data Analysis and Prediction
Analyzing data recorded by measurement tools and log sensors of the drilling environment for Utah Forge well 58-32 for a geothermal reservoir characteristics study. A prediction is made applicable on new data, for recognizing Rate Of Penetration (ROP), by using numerical correlations between ROP and applied drilling parameters. <br> </br>
Drilling data of the well with starting depth of 25 meters and the stop depth was 2.3 km. This data contains information on the nature of the subsurface materials and performance of the drilling rig and drilling bits, including;
- Rate of Penetration (ROP)
- Weight on the drilling bit
- Temperatures of the mud in/out 
- Pit of mud volume
- Pump pressure for pushing mud through bit nozzles
- Hook-load of the drilling pipe
- Applied torque
- Bit rotating speed
- Mud flow rate in/out
- Well Head pressure
- Levels of H2S on the floor, well head level, and down the pit. </ul>
